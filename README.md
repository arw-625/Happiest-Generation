## Explotatory Data Analysis
The data set spanned up until 2016 but the suicide rate was relativeley low for that year. I am not sure if this year was an outlier, of if the 2016 memes were true about it being the happiest year.

It could've also simply be because the data set is not complete (but that's less exciting).
