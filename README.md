## Background and Motivtion
The last 100 years are split into 6 different generations:

Age-Generation Breakdown:

+ Generation Z: 1997-2012
+ Millenials (Generation Y): 1981-1996
+ Generation X: 1965-1980
+ Baby Boomers: 1946-1964
+ Silent Generation: 1928-1945
+ G.I. Generation: 1901-1927

The latest generation is called the Alpha generation and starts from year 2012. 

I would think that the population with the least amount of suicides would be consider the happiest, and I'd like to explore a little further to decide which generation might fall into that category as well. 

## Data

The data set spanned up until 2016 but the suicide rate was relativeley low for that year. I am not sure if this year was an outlier, of if the 2016 memes were true about it being the happiest year.

It could've also simply be because the data set is not complete (but that's less exciting). 

I also used a data set conaining the global populations for the same decade to compare the suicide rate to.


The data consisted of global suicide rates broken down into country and then by generation. After being split up by country and generation the data was also separate by sex. But for the purposes of this project, I will be using the total count male and female individuals 


The columns of the data that I kept included the following:

## Explotatory Data Analysis

Starting 

After some analysis, I found that a there was a lot of zeroes for the suicide count when it came to the G.I. generation. This could be due to the reduction of the population given the range of years that that they were born in.
